Hi, I’m Hartej Singh! Thank you for stopping by my GitHub page as I'm excited to show you all what I have worked on. I'm currently a second year at UCSD studying math and computer science. In my free time, I enjoy working out and playing basketball. This page features a collection of projects that I have worked on/ am currently working on. If you have any questions, please email me at h2singh@ucsd.edu.
